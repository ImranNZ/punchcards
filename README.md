# Punch Cards

This is a code example for NextMinute.

# What has been implemented

A small demo project has been implemented with .NET Core as a backend and ReactJS as a frontend, and aims to demonstrate skills in those areas. The interface allows a user to register on the web application and add 'punch cards', where a description can be provided with the addition of start and end times. The user can also log out and log back in to find their previously entered punch cards.

# What it is not

This aims to show a glimpse of code quality and adherence to SOLID/DRY principles as well as front end ability using react and redux with Bootstrap 4. 

This does not include unit tests, deployment configuration, etc. Due to time constraints and the open ended code sample requested, this is not a full demonstration of what could be implemented.

For improvements, exception checking, logging, unit testing, deployments, etc. could be setup.

# How to run
Run directly from Visual Studio 2017, or in the command line (with dotnet core installed):

> dotnet ef database update

> dotnet run

Click the link in the command line to where it's hosted.
